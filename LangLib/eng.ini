Q1 = "What is it?"
A1 = "RoleGame is a social network primarily intended for playing role-playing games. This is when two users correspond with each other, creating a «book» together - both are authors and each has their own character that they control, which in turn are in a certain world. In addition, RoleGame has the ability to correspond with other users outside the worlds."
Q2 = "What's needed for it?"
A2 = "You don't need to be able to do much - you need to be able to write. Not in the sense of taking a pen or on the keyboard, but composing. It's simple!"
Q3 = "Is it paid?"
A3 = "Not. Of course not. In the service itself there are paid things that allow, for example, to create characters stronger than usual or the creation of private worlds."
Q4 = "History."
A4 = "RoleGame is derived from the popular in 2014 to today role in the social network Vkontakte. There, they look like groups with participants who create characters and worlds and roll (play) together."
